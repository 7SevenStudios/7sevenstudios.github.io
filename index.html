            Hi there! I'm Lou, the founder of 7Seven Studios. I'm a high school student
            and game enthusiast in New York. I started developing in Unity six years ago in 2020
            and have released 11 games on my itch.io. It's always been my dream to release games
            to the world on the same level as the ones I grew up loving. Town of Tinysville is my
            chance to show the world who I am as a developer.
        </p>
