        <p id="regtext2"> I'm an aspiring game developer learning game 
            development, hoping to become much bigger in the future. I started making
            games in Unity in 2020, and have grown to love
            programming since then. At the beginning of 2022, I started 
            expanding my coding knowledge from just C# to java, python, and
            web development (html, css). All of my projects can be found on 
            my itch.io page, and soon on Steam.
        </p>

        <p id="regtext2"> Joining my Discord server would help me grown
            to be a well-known developer in the future. :)
