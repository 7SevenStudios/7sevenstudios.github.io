            7Seven Studios is a one person studio founded in 2020 by Louis DiGiorno III. Although I was born in the
            2000s, my childhood consisted of retro classics like Super Mario and Donkey Kong and I have strived
            to recreate games with that same nostalgic feeling. Town of Tinysville is my first major release that 
            emulates the 80s and 90s. The original Town of Tinysville was made during a game jam in 2021 and was 
            instantly a fan favorite. Four years later, in 2025, I decided to revive the project and create a bigger
            and better Town of Tinysville. This time around, I wanted to challenge myself. I made one of the
            hardest decisions at the beginning of development to keep the retro feel. I did this by reducing the game 
            to a tiny color palette, only consisting of 15 different colors.
